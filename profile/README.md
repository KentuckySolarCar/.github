## Welcome to UK Solar Car's Github!

# Who we are: 
The University of Kentucky Solar Car Team designs, manufactures, and races competitive solar vehicles
while providing our engineers and multi-disciplinary students with much-needed hands-on experience outside
of their demanding course load, all while contributing to STEM outreach in the Bluegrass region.

# About Us:
The University of Kentucky Solar Car team is an independent, student-led organization that operates
on the campus of UK. With a large and active student body, the team works during the school year to
design and construct solar vehicles, which are used in STEM outreach, and to compete in national solar car
competitions which include the Formula Sun Grand Prix and the American Solar Challenge.
